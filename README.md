# MuckScraper — All the Muck That's Fit to Scrape

### A Self-Hosted News Aggregator with LLM Analysis

> **TL;DR:** MuckScraper pulls news from multiple sources, groups articles about the same story together using vector embeddings, scores every outlet for political bias, and gives you a Smart Brevity AI summary — all running on your own hardware with no subscriptions, no tracking, and no algorithm deciding what you see.

## Why This Is Different

Most news aggregators just show you a firehose of headlines. MuckScraper does things no other self-hosted tool does:

**Newspaper-style front page** — A proper broadsheet layout with a ranked, editorially-weighted top 20 stories. Not just a feed — a front page.

**Cross-outlet story clustering** — Articles from CNN, Fox News, Reuters, and AP covering the same event are automatically grouped into a single story using vector embeddings and semantic similarity. See how different outlets cover the same story side by side.

**Political bias scoring** — Every outlet is scored on a 1–5 left-to-right spectrum by your local LLM the first time it appears. Individual articles can be rated separately. No hardcoded bias lists — your LLM makes the call.

**Topic-aware deep reports** — Multi-source stories get in-depth analytical reports tailored to their topic: political stories get left/center/right framing analysis, science stories get findings and expert commentary, sports stories get recaps and standings context, and so on.

**Smart Brevity summaries** — Summaries follow the Axios Smart Brevity format: The big picture, Why it matters, What's happening, What's next.

## What It Does

MuckScraper pulls news from multiple APIs across configurable topic categories on a scheduled basis. Articles are scraped for full text, classified into topics by an LLM, grouped into stories using vector similarity, scored for political bias, ranked by a two-stage LLM pipeline, and displayed in a clean web interface with dark mode support. Generate AI summaries on demand, read full scraped article text, and get deep multi-source analysis — all from your own server.

## Public vs. Admin Routes

MuckScraper's routes are split into blueprints:

**Public** (`/headlines`, `/story/<id>`, `/article/<id>`) — read-only, no authentication required. Safe to expose via reverse proxy.

**Admin** (`/articles`, `/fetch`, `/force-regroup`, etc.) — requires login. All write and trigger operations.

To run a public-facing headlines site, deploy with only the personal blueprint registered and put it behind a reverse proxy.

---

## ⚠️ Security Warning

**Do not expose admin routes to the internet.**

Recommended deployment:
- Full app on local network only (default)
- For a public site: register only the personal blueprint, use Nginx or Caddy as a reverse proxy
- VPN (WireGuard, Tailscale) for remote access to admin routes

---

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- NewsAPI key (free tier: 100 requests/day)
- GNews API key (free tier: 100 requests/day)
- Ollama running on your network with:
  - A chat model (e.g. `llama3.1`, `mistral`)
  - An embedding model (`nomic-embed-text`)
- Langfuse instance (optional — for LLM observability)

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grregis/muckscraper.git
cd muckscraper
cp .env.sample .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and Ollama host
docker compose up --build
# Create your admin user
docker compose exec app python create_admin.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

## Current Features

### News Fetching
- Scheduled fetching 4 times daily (12am, 7am, 12pm, 6pm Eastern) across 7 topic categories
- On-demand fetch via the web interface — by topic or custom search query
- Dual API sources — NewsAPI and GNews fetched for every topic
- Smart restart timer — skips fetch on startup if last fetch was recent
- Duplicate article detection by URL and title+outlet
- Source and title keyword blocklist
- Aggregator deduplication — Yahoo, Google News, MSN articles hidden when original source content exists

### Article Scraping
- Full article text scraped automatically on fetch
- BeautifulSoup + readability-lxml for content extraction
- Playwright fallback for JavaScript-heavy sites
- Googlebot user agent fallback for soft-paywalled sites
- archive.ph fallback as last resort
- Bad scrape detection — login walls, captchas, bot detection pages, and duplicate outlet content automatically detected and cleared
- Automatic domain blocklisting when bad scrapes are detected
- Pre-configured permanent blocklist for hard-paywalled domains
- Retroactive audit via admin UI

### Topic Classification
- LLM-powered topic classification by content
- Topics: US Headlines, US Politics, International Headlines, Science/Technology, Gaming, Sports, Business/Finance
- Articles can belong to multiple topics

### Political Bias Scoring
- Outlet-level bias scoring via LLM on a 1–5 scale (1=Left, 5=Right)
- Scores assigned automatically when a new outlet is first seen
- Per-article bias rating separate from outlet score

### Story Grouping
- Vector embedding-based story clustering using pgvector and nomic-embed-text
- pgvector nearest-neighbour SQL search for re-grouping (replaces O(n²) Python loop)
- LLM disambiguation for borderline matches with content snippet context
- Stories ordered by most recent article date

### Headline Ranking
- 16 RSS feeds polled across the political spectrum
- LLM matches external headlines to MuckScraper stories
- Base score: 67% outlet coverage + 33% article count, with time decay
- Editorial re-ranking: LLM ranks top 50 candidates by real-world importance
- Final score: 60% base, 40% editorial
- Every ranking run logged to `editorial_history` for auditability

### AI-Generated Story Headlines
- Wire service style, 15 words max, present tense active voice
- Generated automatically when a second article is added to a story

### LLM Summarization
- Smart Brevity story summaries: The big picture, Why it matters, What's happening, What's next
- Topic-aware deep reports for multi-source stories
- Per-article summaries in the article reader
- Auto-summarization when Ollama reconnects
- Langfuse tracing on all LLM calls (optional)

### Web Interface
- Newspaper-style headlines front page with masthead, weather widget, and broadsheet layout
- Collapsible sidebar with topic navigation
- Multi-source story cards with left/center/right bias breakdown
- Full article reader with scraped HTML content
- Dark/light mode with preference saved in browser
- Ollama online/offline status indicator
- Local timezone conversion for all article dates
- Authentication with login page and protected admin routes

### Maintenance (admin menu)
- ⚡ Wake Ollama — sends Wake on LAN magic packet (MAC address validated)
- ↻ Ollama Catchup — re-groups, re-rates, and re-summarizes missed content
- ↻ Scrape Missing — bulk re-scrapes articles missing full text
- ⚡ Force Re-group — rebuilds all story groupings from scratch (with confirmation)
- ↻ Reclassify Topics — reclassifies all articles
- 🚫 Scrape Blocklist — view and manage blocked domains
- ⚡ Audit Bad Scrapes — scan all stored content for login walls and duplicates

---

## Customization

### Topics / Categories
Edit `TOPICS` in `aggregator/constants.py` and `SCHEDULED_FETCHES` in `news_fetcher/scheduler.py`.

### LLM Provider
LLM calls are isolated in: `outlet_bias_llm.py`, `summarizer.py`, `topic_classifier.py`, `story_grouper.py`, `headline_generator.py`, `headline_ranker.py`, `editorial_ranker.py`.

### Blocked Sources
Add domains or title keywords to `BLOCKED_SOURCES` and `BLOCKED_TITLE_KEYWORDS` in `news_fetcher/fetch_and_store_articles.py`. Scraper-level domain blocking is managed via the admin UI.

---

## Maintenance Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `./restart.sh` | Soft rebuild — clears cache, rebuilds images, keeps database |
| `create_admin.py` | Create or reset admin user credentials |
| `cleanup_duplicates.py` | Deduplicate articles by URL and title+outlet |
| `backfill_images.py` | Backfill image URLs from stored raw API payloads |

---

## Known Limitations

- Hard-paywalled sites (NYT, Washington Post, WSJ) cannot be fully scraped — pre-blocked
- Topic classification accuracy depends on LLM quality
- Story clustering quality depends on Ollama being online during fetches
- No mobile-responsive layout yet
